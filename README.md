# Predicting-Houses-Prices

 Develop a model that can predict the prices of houses based on features like size, number of rooms, age, and location.

## Dataset

 For this project dataset I will be using the "Boston Housing Dataset", which is a well-known dataset containing information about various houses in Boston along various parameters such as crime rate, property tax rate, number of rooms, etc.

## Dataset attributes description
  
  The dataset contains a total of 506 cases.

 1. CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
 2. ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
 3. INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
 4. CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
 5. NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
 6. RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
 7. AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
 8. DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
 9. RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
 10. TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
 11. PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
 12. B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
 13. LSTAT - % lower status of the population
 14. MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
